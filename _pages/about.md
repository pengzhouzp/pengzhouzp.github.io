I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). You can call me Peng or ZP. I am broadly interested in brain-inspired computing. My research with Prof. Sung-Mo "Steve" Kang at Nanoelectronic Integrated Systems Laboratory focuses on neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks and their hardware implementation using memristors. I also obtained working experience from Synsense which is a neuromorphic chip company based on their academic work at the Institute of Neuroinformatics of the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. I received my bachelor’s degree from the Undergraduate Program of Experimental Class for Automation in the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation (AIA) at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2016.

I am passionate about a multidisciplinary approach to the future, including electrical and computer engineering, cognitive science, neuroscience, philosophy, etc. I am also a fan of basketball, skateboarding, snowboarding, ukulele, cats, Chinese calligraphy, and meditation. Feel free to reach out to me!
