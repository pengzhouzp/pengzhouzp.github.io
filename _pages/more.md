I grew up in [Changsha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changsha), China, which is a fascinating city full of culture and history. 
I went to Huazhong University of Science and Technology ([HUST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology)) 
in Wuhan after high school. 
In this forest-like beautiful university, I learned a lot of engineering knowledge, some cognitive science, and politics, 
which led me to wonder how our mystery brain works. Besides courses, I spent much time on my favourite sport——basketball, 
joined our university women's basketball team, and played in the Chinese University Basketball Association (CUBA) —— Chinese 'NCAA'. 
Moreover, I have been the 'dream teacher' in [Teach For China](https://chinadevelopmentbrief.cn/ngos/teach-for-china/) 
and helped the students in rural areas with a shortage of educational resources.

After I came to Santa Cruz as a graduate student, 
I enjoyed the multicultural environment and served as the solidarity officer in the executive board of the UCSC 
[Graduate Students Association](https://gsa.ucsc.edu/about/executive-board/executive-board-2018-2019/) in the 2018-2019 academic year
and vice president in the executive board of the UCSC [Graduate Student Commons](https://gradcommons.ucsc.edu/governance/) in the 2020-2021 academic year. 
UCSC [IEEE HKN](https://ieeehkn.sites.ucsc.edu/) is the other organization I volunteer as an officer. 
I tried skateboarding, snowboarding, kayaking, and dinghy sailing here, which are all pretty exciting.
Ukulele is my favourite instrument, and it fits the beach vibes in Santa Cruz very well.
I explored more about brain-inspired computing and read a lot to draw inspiration,
some of which are listed [here](https://pengzhouzp.github.io/theories/).
