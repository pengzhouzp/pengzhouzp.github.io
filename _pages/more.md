I grew up in <b>[Changsha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changsha)</b>, China, which is a fascinating city full of culture and history. 
I went to Huazhong University of Science and Technology (<b>[HUST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology)</b>) 
in Wuhan after high school. 
In this forest-like beautiful university, I learned a lot of engineering knowledge, some cognitive science, and politics, 
which led me to wonder how our mystery brain works. Besides courses, I spent much time on my favourite sport——basketball, 
joined our university women's basketball team and played in the Chinese University Basketball Association (CUBA) —— Chinese 'NCAA'. 
Moreover, I have been the 'dream teacher' in <b>[Teach For China](https://chinadevelopmentbrief.cn/ngos/teach-for-china/)</b>
and helped the students in rural areas with a shortage of educational resources.

After I came to Santa Cruz as a graduate student, 
I enjoyed the multicultural environment and served as the solidarity officer on the executive board of the UCSC 
<b>[Graduate Students Association](https://gsa.ucsc.edu/about/executive-board/executive-board-2018-2019/)</b> in the 2018-2019 academic year
and vice president on the executive board of the UCSC <b>[Graduate Student Commons](https://gradcommons.ucsc.edu/governance/)</b> in the 2020-2021 academic year. 
UCSC <b>[IEEE HKN](https://ieeehkn.sites.ucsc.edu/)</b> is the other organization I volunteer as an officer. 
I tried skateboarding, snowboarding, kayaking, and dinghy sailing here, which are all pretty exciting.
Ukulele is my favourite instrument, and it fits the beach vibes in Santa Cruz very well.
I explored more about brain-inspired computing and read a lot to draw inspiration,
some of which are listed <b>[here](https://pengzhouzp.github.io/theories/)</b>.

After graduation in 2022, I officially became Dr. Zhou, a title that marks not just the completion of my phd journey, but also a profound personal transformation. It was a truly wonderful journey to pursue my phd degree at the UCSC, at California. The stunning natural environment, the deep and genuine connections among people, and the loving, supportive community all affect me profoundly. During these years, I grew not only in research and logic but also in emotion, self-understanding, and love for both myself and the world. I am deeply thankful to my family, advisors, and friends in both China and the States for their constant encouragement and support. Although my five years phd journey included three years of the pandemic, which really limited my opportunities to explore national parks, outdoor adventures, and time with friends, I still received much love, care, and kindness. For that, I could not be more grateful.

For the next chapter of my life, I has given careful thought. My research focuss on brain-inspired AI, a field that is now moving beyond the laboratory toward practical, impactful technologies. With experience working in outstanding startups on both algorithms and hardware, I chose to take a step toward industry and founded my own company, LuxiTech, in Shenzhen. The name comes from Lucy, the famous 3.2-million-year-old hominin fossil discovered in Ethiopia. During the excavation, the team repeatedly played the Beatles song *Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds*, which inspired the nickname. This connection between ancient human evolution and modern imagination deeply resonates with our mission. The name also echoes the film *Lucy* starring Scarlett Johansson, which explores the expansion of human cognitive potential. We develop brain-inspired large language models that are lightweight, secure, and optimized for offline deployment on edge devices. These models offer low computational cost, enhanced privacy, and strong potential for real-world applications where cloud access is limited or undesirable.

Transitioning from academia to industry has been both challenging and transformative. Unlike research alone, building a company requires strategic thinking while also handling countless operational details. This experience taught me how deeply the world is shaped by products and commercialization. We cannot remain in the lab forever, and we must bring technology to life to serve society. I find great joy in this process and continue to grow through each challenge.

At the same time, I remain closely connected to the academic world through publishing, peer review, and international conference participation. Deep down, I have always loved research and the academic community that surrounds it. So I have been holding a postdoctoral position at City University of Hong Kong since 2025. Shenzhen and Hong Kong are neighboring cities, and many people commute between them, even during weekdays, for work and daily life. This dual-city lifestyle has become my rhythm, and it has become a lifestyle I genuinely enjoy. I rarely followed a meticulously planned path, often I let my interests and instincts guide me, sometimes wandering into unexpected directions. Staying true to what truly inspires me has led to a journey that feels meaningful and I am very curious where it takes me.
