During this unprecedented Covid-19 period, we are just working from home, 
wearing a mask everywhere, not talking with family and friends quite much, 
becoming less efficient and lazy, using phones and watching TV quite often, pretty isolated and lonely. 
We look forward to a normal life while concerning about the situation around the world. 
We enjoy our private space and time while longing for connection with others. 
We want to reunite while afraid to be disturbed.

I am deeply sorry for all of you who lost someone or something during this time. 
I also suffered quite much in 2020 due to multiple reasons. 
However, in 2021, I tried hard to cheer myself up, and it seems quite successful until now. 
The methods include: 
(1) regularly excise, I start playing tennis and skateboard, and of course, I keep playing basketball. 
(2) set up a standing working table, super important for those who work with computers. 
(3) go out to view some natural landscape, even sunrise and sunset will make you feel better. 
(4) cook healthy food. (5) clean your room, definitely feel better. 
(6) message, voice call, video call your friends, many people in the comfort zone and hesitate to reach out to others, 
it actually turns out to be a pretty happy time when I reach out to friends, even those who I might haven't connected for a long time. 
(7) I personally feel lofi, dreampop, chillwave, jazzpop, these types of music helps. 
(8) involve in organizing some events, help to keep the world going on!

I think it would be a good chance to share more of my personal life here to connect with everyone. 
If any of my pictures and words can encourage and support you, it is my pleasure, and let's get in touch!

<th colspan="2">In Chinese culture, we attached "福" (pronounce "Fu", meaning "blessing") reversely in the front door of our house. As "reverse" has the same pronounce as "arrive" in Chinese, we hope the coming new year will arrive with fortune. The above two "福" are written by me with different styles in calligraphy. I wish you all a happy new year!</th>
